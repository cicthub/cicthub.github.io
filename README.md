# CICT (Computational Information Conservation Theory)
This is the official site for the CICT community all around the mind-world.
This hub was created to collect and share all the contributions to the CIC Theory issued by Prof. Rodolfo A. Fiorini.

A new approach to science and bio-centric technologies is proposed and shared with the aim to grow up an innovative collaborative and multidisciplinary inquiry.
