      <span class="dropcap">D</span>iscrete Tomography (DT), differently from GT and CT, focuses on the case where only few specimen projections are known and the images contain a small number of different colours (e.g. black-and-white). A concise review on main contemporary
      physical and mathematical CT system problems is offered. Stochastic vs. Combinatorially Optimized Noise generation is compared and presented by two visual examples to emphasise a major double-bind problem at the core of contemporary most advanced
      instrumentation systems. Automatic tailoring denoising procedures to real dynamic system characteristics and performance can get closer to ideal self-registering and self-linearizing system to generate virtual uniform and robust probing field during
      its whole designed service life-cycle. The first attempt to develop basic principles for system background low-level noise source automatic characterization, profiling and identification by CICT, from discrete system parameter, is presented. As
      a matter of fact, CICT can supply us with cyclic numeric sequences perfectly tuned to their low-level multiplicative source generators, related to experimental high-level overall perturbation (according to high-level classic perturbation computational
      model under either additive or multiplicative perturbation hypothesis). Numeric examples are presented. Furthermore, a practical NTT example is given. Specifically, advanced CT system, HRO and Mission Critical Project (MCP) for very low Technological
      Risk (TR) and Crisis Management (CM) system will be highly benefitted mostly by CICT infocentric worldview. The presented framework, concepts and techniques can be used to boost the development of next generation algorithms and advanced applications
      quite conveniently.
